# World Data Mapper

#### Getting Started
* In the root directory (TodoTracker/) run npm install
* Go to the client directory(TodoTracker/client) using cd client and run  npm install again.
* Return to the root directory using cd ..

You now have everything you need to start the application, and there are two options for starting the application:

* Run npm start in the root directory
* Run nodemon in the root directory and npm start in the client directory

Generally option 1 is the preferred method as it is more convenient than manually running two separate scripts, but depending on what youâ€™re working on, having both the front and back end servers running may be unnecessary.
